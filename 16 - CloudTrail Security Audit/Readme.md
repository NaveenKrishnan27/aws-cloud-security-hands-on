# Day 16 â€“ CloudTrail Security Audit

âœ… **What I Did**
- Enabled AWS CloudTrail across all regions to monitor API calls.
- Created a new S3 bucket for storing CloudTrail logs.
- Simulated IAM policy changes to generate security events.
- Analyzed events in CloudTrail Event History.

ðŸ§  **Key Learnings**
- CloudTrail provides full visibility into AWS account activity.
- IAM changes like policy detachments are logged with full detail.
- Real-time filtering helps detect unauthorized actions quickly.
