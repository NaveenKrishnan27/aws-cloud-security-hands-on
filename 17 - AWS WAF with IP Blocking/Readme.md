# Day 17 â€“ AWS WAF IP Blocking

## âœ… **What I Did**
- Created a WAF Web ACL and attached it to a CloudFront distribution.
- Blocked specific IP addresses from accessing my static website.
- Verified behavior by simulating access before and after blocking.

## ðŸ§  **Key Learnings**
- AWS WAF allows fine-grained control over web traffic.
- Web ACLs can protect applications against IP abuse, bots, and more.
- CloudFront integrates easily with WAF for edge-level security.
