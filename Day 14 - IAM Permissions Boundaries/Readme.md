# Day 14 â€“ IAM Permissions Boundary

## âœ… What I Did
- Created a custom IAM permissions boundary that only allows S3 actions  
- Created an IAM user with a policy allowing both S3 and EC2  
- Attached the permissions boundary to the user  
- Verified S3 access works and EC2 access is denied using AWS CLI  

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Permissions boundaries define the maximum allowed permissions  
- Even if IAM policies grant access, boundaries can restrict it further  
- Effective permissions = IAM policy âˆ© permissions boundary  
- Useful for managing over-permissioning in large environments
